.. teaser-start

``statstream`` is a lightweight Python package providing data analysis and statistics utilities for streaming data.

Its main goal is to provide **single-pass** variants of conventional `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_
data analysis and statistics functionality for **streaming** data that is
either generated on the fly or to large to be handled at once. Data can be
streamed as in chunks called **mini-batches**, which makes ``statstream``
extremely useful in combination with machine learning and deep learning
packages like `keras <https://keras.io/>`_, `tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_, or `pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.

.. example

``statstream`` functions consume iterators providing batches of data.
They compute statistics of these batches and combine them to obtain statistics
for the full data set.

.. code-block:: python

   import statstream
   mean = statstream.streaming_mean(some_iterable)

The `Overview <https://statstream.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_ and
`Examples <https://statstream.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_ sections
of our documentation provide more realistic and complete examples.
